### 🚀 My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've developed:

-   **Near Real-Time Simultaneous Multimodal Translation:** Developed a system that uses deep learning and NLP for instant language translation with personalized voice output. [cite: 13, 14, 15]
-   **Image Super-Resolution using CNNs:** Built a custom CNN model to upscale low-resolution images by 4x, enhancing visual quality. [cite: 17, 20, 21]
-   **Automated OCR to Excel Dashboard:** Designed a pipeline with a GUI to automate file conversion, text extraction using Tesseract, and data visualization. [cite: 24, 27, 28, 29]
-   **Abstract Art Evolution using Evolutionary Algorithms:** Implemented genetic algorithms to autonomously generate and optimize abstract artwork via a web application. [cite: 31, 34, 35]
